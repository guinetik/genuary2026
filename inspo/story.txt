esthetic — structures "build themselves" by revealing cubes progressively, like unlocking tech tiers.
States:

ARRIVAL — Single blocky rocket (built from cube3d) approaches and enters orbit around the star. Empty, frontier feeling. Just the ship and the star.
DEPLOYMENT — Rocket settles into orbit. Solar panels deploy from the ship. First energy collection begins. Maybe a few small cube satellites separate out.
CAPITOL — Cubes progressively reveal to form a main station/hub. Use the visibility tracker pattern — geometry already exists, just fade/pop in blocks as if resources are being spent to construct. Station should look like the blocky voxel stations we already have but assembling piece by piece.
EMPIRE — Multiple annex stations begin forming at different orbital positions. Mining operations visible near the star. The swarm densifies. Full Dyson sphere energy.

Technical approach:

Use existing procedural station generation but add visibility state to each cube. cities are determined at the start. they are just not visible bc all cubes are hidden. 
State machine controls which phase we're in and triggers the reveal sequences
Cubes can pop in or fade in — whichever feels better
Keep the cyan/teal monochromatic palette
Star remains the glowing white anchor throughout

Timing: Auto-advance between states with enough time to appreciate each phase. Maybe 10-20 seconds per state?
